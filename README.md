This project uses [mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/), [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [vs code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) debug toghether, so you can write your api tests easily.

This is useful for scenarios when you've some api developed in python **for example**, but you'd prefer to develop tests in typescript/javascript.

Another use case is when you've some legacy api and you want to develop some tests to make [risk free change] of your legacy api possibel!

You can use wide variety of [chai plugins](https://www.chaijs.com/plugins/) alongside with ECMA 2018 features!

To start, take a look at [test.ts](test/test.ts)
